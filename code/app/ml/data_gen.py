"""
Synthetic dataset generator (Stage 1).

Real SHG/loan data doesn't exist for this project, so every downstream module
(scoring engine, bootstrap logic, lender matching, clustering, anomaly
detection) has to work off data we make up -- but it has to be made up with
real *structure*, or the scoring model has nothing to learn and every result
downstream is theater.

The core trick: every individual gets a hidden "true creditworthiness" latent
trait (`z`, roughly standard-normal) that we never store directly. Every
*observable* signal -- repayment behaviour, savings regularity, SHG meeting
attendance -- is generated as a noisy function of that latent trait. That's
what makes this a legitimate ML problem instead of a random number generator:
the model has to recover `z` from noisy correlated observations, the same way
a real credit model recovers creditworthiness from noisy correlated bureau
data.

Two deliberate modelling choices worth knowing about, because they shape what
the trained model (Stage 2) will learn:

1. SHG-linked and independent individuals draw `z` from the *same*
   distribution. SHG membership is not used as a proxy for "this person is
   inherently more creditworthy" -- that would bake a fairness problem into
   the ground truth before the model ever sees it, and it would contradict
   the project's own premise that independents can be just as good.
2. SHG membership DOES have a real (small) causal bump on top of `z`: members
   of a strong SHG get a modest boost to their *observed* repayment behaviour
   (peer accountability is a real phenomenon -- it's literally why SHG
   lending works in practice). That's separate from the score BOOTSTRAP
   advantage handled in Stage 3; this is about behaviour, that's about prior.
