"""
Core scoring engine training (Stage 2).

Per the project plan, the MVP model is trained on SHG-linked individuals
only: they're the population with the richest signal (attendance, peer
repayment rate, SHG tenure, on top of the loan/savings history everyone has),
so that's where a first model has the best chance of being genuinely
predictive rather than guessing. Stage 3 (app/services/bootstrap.py) is what
extends coverage to independent borrowers -- it reuses this exact trained
model (independents just have SHG-specific features imputed as "no group",
not a different model) and blends its output with a path-appropriate prior.

Label: does this individual have at least one Defaulted/Written_Off loan in
their history? That's a legitimate target for a credit model -- using a
borrower's own past repayment behaviour to predict portfolio-level default
risk is exactly what real bureau-based scoring does; the "leakage" concern
would only apply if we used a single loan's own outcome to predict that same
loan, which we don't.
