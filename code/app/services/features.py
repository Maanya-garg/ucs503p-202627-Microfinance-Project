"""
Feature engineering -- shared, on purpose, between the offline training
script (app/ml/train_scoring_model.py) and the online scoring service
(app/services/scoring_service.py). If those two computed features
differently you'd get train/serve skew: the model would be evaluated on data
that doesn't match what it sees in production. Both call `compute_raw_features`.

Every rate/ratio feature is `np.nan` when there's no underlying data (e.g. an
independent borrower with zero savings records has `savings_regularity =
NaN`, not 0 -- 0 would falsely say "never saves" when the truth is "unknown").
NaN is handled explicitly at both train time (median imputation, stats
persisted) and inference time (same persisted stats), never silently.
